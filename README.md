# BACKGROUND

Understanding the dynamics of the job market is crucial for both job seekers aiming to align their skills with market demands and employers seeking to attract top talent.
This analysis focus is on uncovering key insights into the remote data analytics sector.
To support these insights, a set of SQL queries was developed to systematically extract and analyze relevant data points from the dataset. These queries provide a transparent and replicable method for exploring market trends, skill valuations, and educational requirements in the remote data analytics job market...


The data originates from Luke Barousse‚Äôs comprehensive SQL course, which can be found at (https://lukebarousse.com/sql). This dataset is rich with valuable insights covering a wide range of topics, including various job titles, salary information, geographical locations, and the essential skills required for those positions.
   
## The objective of my SQL queries was to address the following questions:

1. What data analyst positions offer the highest salaries?
2. What skills are commonly required for these high-paying roles?
3. Which skills are most in demand for data analyst positions overall?
4. Which specific skills are linked to higher salary levels?
5. What are the most beneficial skills for a data analyst to learn?
6. Are practical skills considered more valuable than qualifications in this field?

# TOOLS USED FOR THE ANALYSIS
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I leveraged a set of powerful tools to guide my analysis:

- **SQL:** The foundation of my data exploration, enabling me to query databases and extract meaningful insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** My preferred database management system, well-suited for handling job posting data efficiently.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My primary workspace for managing the database and executing SQL queries seamlessly.
- **Git & GitHub:** Vital for version control and collaboration, allowing me to track progress and share my SQL scripts and findings effectively.
- **Python:** This is my go-to programming language for data visualization, as it seamlessly integrates into my workflow and provides a wide range of powerful libraries and tools that make it easy to create clear, informative, and visually compelling representations of data...


# THE ANALYSIS
Each query in this project was designed to explore particular elements of the data analyst job market. Below is an overview of how each question was addressed.


### 1. What data analyst positions offer the highest salaries?
To uncover the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions based on average annual salary and location, with a particular focus on remote opportunities. This query reveals top-tier earning potential within data analyst field.

```sql

job_location,
job_schedule_type,
salary_year_avg,
name AS Company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim 
ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
AND
job_location = 'Anywhere'
AND
salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
### INSIGHTS:

- **High Salary Potential:** Top positions offer between \$184,000 and \$650,000 annually.
